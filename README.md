## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- React.js
- SCSS module
- ExpressJS
- JWT
- TypeScript

### What I learned

With this challenge, I learned how to build an API with ExpressJS and deploy it to Heroku.
I also learned how to manage a Redux-like global state with React native hooks useContext and useReducer.

### Useful resources

- [Replace Redux with useReducer](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/replace-redux-with-usereducer-100406773332) - This helped me to use useReducer and useContext to replace Redux in TypeScript.
- [Node.js, Express.js, and PostgreSQL: CRUD REST API example](https://blog.logrocket.com/nodejs-expressjs-postgresql-crud-rest-api-example/) - This helped me to build my REST API with ExpressJS and PostgreSQL.
